## What's React JSX?

[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/), or JavaScript XML, is a JavaScript syntax extension that looks similar to HTML. [React JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) lets you create `ReactElement` objects using an HTML-like syntax and a transpiler.

For example, when the following React JSX code is run through a transpiler:

```html
<h1 id="greeting">Hello, Jane.</h1>
```

It's transformed into the following JavaScript code.

```js
React.createElement('h1', { id: 'greeting' }, 'Hello, Jane.')
```

A traditional **compiler** translates the source code of one programming language into another programming language of a *different* level of abstraction. For example, embedded JavaScript (i.e. EJS) templates compile into HTML because one is an embedded programming language and the other is only a markup language.

```text
┌────────────────  EJS  ────────────────┐               ┌─────── HTML ───────┐
│                                       │               │                    │
│                                       │               │                    │
│ <h1 id="greeting">                    │               │ <h1 id="greeting"> │
│   Hello, <%= 'Jane'.toUpperCase() %>. │─── compile ──▶│   Hello, JANE.     │
│ </h1>                                 │               │ </h1>              │
│                                       │               │                    │
│                                       │               │                    │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘               └────────────────────┘
```

A **transpiler** is a special type of compiler. Given the source code of one programming language, a transpiler produces equivalent source code in another programming language of approximately the *same* level of abstraction. For example, TypeScript transpiles into JavaScript because both languages are similar in capabilities.

```text
┌────────────── TypeScript ───────────────┐                  ┌────────────── JavaScript ───────────────┐
│                                         │                  │                                         │
│ function greeter(who: string) {         │                  │ function greeter(who) {                 │
│   return `Hello, ${who.toUpperCase()}`; │                  │   return `Hello, ${who.toUpperCase()}`; │
│ }                                       │─── transpile ───▶│ }                                       │
│                                         │                  │                                         │
│ greeter('Jane');                        │                  │ greeter('Jane');                        │
│                                         │                  │                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘                  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The take away is that JSX is *not* a template language even though it looks like one. Template languages are compiled into HTML while JSX is transpiled into JavaScript. They're both approximately at the same level of abstraction.

│                                    │                  │ );                      │
│                                    │                  │                         │
└────────────────────────────────────┘                  └─────────────────────────┘
```

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is by far the most popular JavaScript transpiler and ships with built-in support for React JSX. There are a number of ways to transpile React JSX with Babel. However, the most popular way is with the help of a Node package, which you'll install later in this article.

Additionally, the [language-babel](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel) package brings JSX syntax highlighting to Atom. Go ahead and install that now by following these steps.

1. Open the Atom preferences with `Cmd + ,`.
1. Click on the "Install" tab in the side navigation.
1. Search for the `language-babel` package in the main screen.
1. And click on its "Install" button.

If you have Emmet installed and you would like to use its functionality inside of `.jsx` files simply:

1) Click Atom -> Keymap
2) When the file `keymap.cson` pops up, paste this code at the bottom: 
```
'atom-text-editor[data-grammar="source js jsx"]:not([mini])':
  'shift-tab': 'emmet:expand-abbreviation-with-tab'
```

Now you can press shift and tab to expand regular text into HTML tags inside of `.jsx` files! You can change the particular key mapping to whatever you choose by changing `shift-tab` to whatever keys you'd prefer.

### Exercise

Turn to a neighbor and, in your own words, explain what React JSX is as well as the similarities and differences of a compiler versus a transpiler. After about a minute, your instructor will cold call on the class and ask what was discussed.

## Why use React JSX?

Simply put, JSX makes building React user interfaces easier. But everyone has their own workflow, so JSX is not required to use React. However, we recommend using React JSX because of its concise and familiar syntax. Plus, it's a very small amount of syntax to learn. If you're not immediately sold on React JSX, that's fine, but [give it five minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes).

You'll find that a React user interface written in JSX is a better way to separate concerns than the traditional division of presentation and behavior. That's because:

1. Presentation and behavior are intimately tied together, so why keep them in separate HTML and JavaScript files.
2. Dedicated template languages tend to be inadequate when implementing a complex user interface.

While at first it may feel jarring to write HTML-like syntax with your JavaScript, using the expressive power of a full programming language to build a complex user interface is an ideal solution to the above problems. In short, React JSX allows presentation and behavior to live side-by-side using the power of JavaScript, but with a concise and familiar syntax.

### Exercise

Take a moment to write down why React JSX is important. Include some of its advantages and disadvantages. After about a minute, your instructor will cold call on the class and ask what was written down.

## How do you use React JSX to build a user interface?

Under the hood, React JSX transforms HTML-like elements, attributes, and children into arguments that are passed to the `React.createElement()` function. As you'll see, both HTML tags and React component classes can be transformed from JSX to JavaScript.

For the following code examples, use the [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/) to transpile the React JSX into JavaScript. Type each code example out *by hand* and then write down your answers to each question.

### HTML tag

As you might expect, an HTML tag uses a lowercase JSX tag name. Remember, `class` and `for` are reserved keywords in JavaScript, so instead `className` and `htmlFor` must be used for attributes.

```jsx
const element = <p className="bold">Tokyo Dog</p>;
```

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?
- **True or False:** Babel adds `use strict;` at the top of the transpiled output.

### Nested HTML tags

Additionally, HTML tags can be nested in JSX.

```jsx
const element = <ul>
  <li className="completed">Molly Moon</li>
  <li>Pie Mobile</li>
</ul>;
```

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?

### React component class

A React component class can also be transformed from JSX to JavaScript. First, create a component class and store it in an identifier that starts with an uppercase letter. Then, use that identifier as the JSX tag name. The lowercase and uppercase convention helps to distinguish between HTML tags and React component classes.

```jsx
const Truck = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return <div>
      <a href="http://www.streetdonuts.com/">Street Donuts</a>
    </div>;
  }
});

const element = <Truck />;
```

As previously mentioned, component classes must specify a `render()` function that returns a single `ReactElement` object. But that single `ReactElement` object can contain other `ReactElement` objects as children. This is the first key to building complex user interfaces.

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?
- What is the `displayName` of the component class?
- What type of object does the `render()` function return?

### Nested React component classes

Additionally, component classes can be nested within other JSX tags. This is the second key to building complex user interfaces.

```jsx
const Truck = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return <li>
      <a href="http://www.streetdonuts.com/">Street Donuts</a>
    </li>;
  }
});

const Trucks = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return <ul>
      <Truck />
    </ul>;
  }
});

const element = <Trucks />;
```

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?
- What is the `displayName` of each component class?
- **True or False:** Self-closing JSX tags must end with `/>`.

### Single-line attribute expressions

A JSX tag's attribute value can be the result of a JavaScript expression. This is useful when you want to inline the full power of JavaScript within a JSX tag. JavaScript expressions are wrapped in a pair of curly braces `{}` instead of double quotes `""`.

```jsx
const source = 'http://i.imgur.com/nVPXKtz.jpg';
const element = <img src={source} alt="Saffron Spice" />;
```

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?

### Multi-line attribute expressions

It's common for attributes of a JSX tag to stretch beyond your preferred line length. In cases like this, you can switch to defining one attribute per line. We recommend ordering attributes alphabetically and closing the JSX tag on a separate line, just like curly braces `{}` and parenthesis `()` in JavaScript.

```jsx
const element = <input
  onChange={this.handleChange}
  type="text"
  value={this.state.searchTerm}
/>;
```

In the wild, you may see multi-line JSX tags wrapped in parenthesis. Syntactically, this provides no benefit and just increases the indentation level unnecessarily.

```jsx
// UNNECESSARY PARENTHESIS
const element = (
  <input
    onChange={this.handleChange}
    type="text"
    value={this.state.searchTerm}
  />
);
```
- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?

### Child expressions

In addition to an attribute value, the result of JavaScript expressions can also be the child of a JSX tag. These expressions use the exact same curly brace `{}` notation.

```jsx
const food = 'Cheese';
const element = <p>{food} Wizards</p>;
```

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?

### Boolean attributes

Boolean attribute values are frequently needed when using HTML form elements with attributes like `disabled`, `required`, `checked` and `readOnly`.

```jsx
const element1 = <input type="button" disabled />;
const element2 = <input type="button" disabled={true} />;
const element3 = <input type="button" disabled={false} />;
```

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?
- Which JSX tags are equivalent?

### Ternary attribute expressions

The only conditional statement that works inside of JSX is a ternary expression. An `if` statement doesn't work because JSX is just syntactic sugar for JavaScript function calls.

```jsx
const isHealthy = false;
const element = <div className={isHealthy ? 'hide' : 'show'} />;
```

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?
- **True or False:** Any element can be a self-closing JSX tag if it has no children.

### Ternary child expressions

In addition to attributes, a ternary expression can be used as a child of a JSX tag.

```jsx
const isHealthy = false;
const element = <div>
  {isHealthy ? <p>Yuck!</p> : <p>Delicious!</p>}
</div>;
```

If a ternary expression isn't robust enough, you can use an `if` statement outside of your JSX.

```jsx
const isHealthy = false;
let message;

if (isHealthy) {
  message = <p>Yuck!</p>;
}
else {
  message = <p>Delicious!</p>;
}

const element = <div>
  {message}
</div>;
```

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?

### Style attribute expressions

To add an inline style to a JSX tag, pass a JavaScript object with a camelcase CSS property to its `style` attribute.

**NOTE:** Vendor prefixes, other than `ms`, begin with a capital letter. This is why `WebkitTransition` has an uppercase `W`.

```jsx
const styles = {
  backgroundColor: 'darkblue',
  color: 'lightgreen',
  msTransition: 'all', // 'ms' is the only lowercase vendor prefix
  WebkitTransition: 'all' // note the capital 'W' here
};

const element = <p style={styles}>Happy Grillmore</p>;
```

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?

### Comments

In JSX, it's possible to comment out both attributes and children. But remember, commented code is the same as dead code. Just delete it!

```jsx
const element = <div>
  <p>It’s Bao Time</p>
  {/* <p>Chopstix</p> */}
  <input
    // type="text"
    value="ThaiUUp" // value="Skillet"
  />
</div>;
```

- How many `ReactElement` objects are created?
- What are their `type`, `props`, and `children`?
- **True or False:** A JSX child can only be commented with the `/* */` style of comment.

### Building a React JSX user interface

Let's build a React JSX user interface by refactoring the **Hello world** React user interface from the previous article into JSX.

Unfortunately, you can't serve React JSX to a browser and expect it to parse or execute the code. Instead, you'll need the help of a build tool. A **build tool** is a program that automates the creation of a functioning application from source code. In this case, you'll use a build tool to transpile React JSX code into functioning JavaScript code before it's sent to a browser.

There are many, many build tools for JavaScript; Brunch, Grunt, Gulp, Brocolli, and Webpack just to name a few. The reason why there are so many build tools is because they all excel at different things. For now, we're going to use [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) because it excels at being easy of use out-of-the-box. However, you'll certainly encounter other build tools in the wild.

To get started, install the Brunch build tool globally with NPM.

```shell
npm install -g brunch
```

Using the freshly installed `brunch` command, create a new application called `hello` with the [`ryansobol/with-react`](https://github.com/ryansobol/with-react) skeleton. A **skeleton** creates files and directories that are a good starting point for a new application.

**NOTE:** The `-s` flag is the shorthand form of the `--skeleton` flag.

```shell
brunch new hello --skeleton ryansobol/with-react
```

Change into the `hello` project directory.

```shell
cd hello
```

Let's walkthrough the files and directories provided by the skeleton starting with the `README.md` file.

```shell
less README.md
```

Watch the project for changes and launch an HTTP server.

**NOTE:** Press `Ctrl + C` to quit.

```shell
npm start
```

And you should see something like this.

```text
> @0.1.0 start /Users/ryansobol/Projects/week15/hello
> brunch watch --server

31 Aug 06:58:47 - info: application started on http://localhost:8000/
31 Aug 06:58:50 - info: compiled 175 files into 4 files, copied 3 in 3.9 sec
```

In a new Terminal tab, navigate back the the project directory.

```shell
cd path/to/hello
```

Take a look at the `public` directory to see what Brunch created.

```shell
la public
```

And you should see something like this.

```text

```

Most of the files should look familiar with the exception of a handful of source map files that end with the `.map` file extension. A **source map** is a file that tells a browser how to debug transpiled and optimized JavaScript code. You'll see what that means in a moment.

Open the application in your default browser.

```shell
open http://localhost:8000/
```

And you should see something like this.

![](https://students-gschool-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/372/Screen_Shot_2016-09-02_at_10.37.18_AM.png)

Assuming your default browser is Chrome, if you open the Chrome Developer Tools and click on the Sources tab, then you should see something like this.

![](https://students-gschool-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/371/Screen_Shot_2016-09-02_at_10.31.02_AM.png)

Because Brunch automatically generated source map files, you can see, right from the browser, what the source code looked like before it was transpiled. Even better, when a runtime error is thrown, Chrome will associate the error with the correct line number of the original source file.

For example, in `app/components/App.jsx` file, type the following code.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    console.log(unknown);
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
});

export default App;
```

Save the file, switch back to the Terminal, and inspect the Brunch output. You should see something like this.

```text
31 Aug 07:05:20 - info: compiled App.jsx and 1 cached file into app.js in 90ms
```

As you can see, Brunch automatically transpiled the `App.jsx` file and updated the `app.js` file. Even though it didn't explicitly state it, Brunch also updated the `app.js.map` file as well. All in under 100ms!

Now, switch back to the browser and open the Console tab in the Chrome Developer Tools. You should see something like this.

![](https://students-gschool-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/374/Screen_Shot_2016-09-02_at_10.43.34_AM.png)

Notice the page has automatically refreshed itself thanks to the [`auto-reload-brunch`](https://github.com/brunch/auto-reload-brunch) plugin. This plugin tells the browser to refresh the page each time Brunch builds the application. That way the code in Atom is always the same as the code in the browser. Neat!

Additionally, notice the `ReferenceError` shown in the Console refers to line number 5 of the `App.jsx` file. Click on the error's link and you should see something like this.

![](https://students-gschool-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/375/Screen_Shot_2016-09-02_at_10.45.12_AM.png)

As you can see, Chrome associated the thrown runtime error with the correct line number of the original source file. Awesome!

Now, switch back to Atom and, inside the `app/components/App.jsx` file, refactor the `App` component class with the following code. No worries if you type the code incorrectly. Just remember that syntax errors will show up in the Brunch output while runtime errors will show up in the browser console.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { who: 'world' };
  },

  handleChange(event) {
    const nextWho = event.target.value;

    this.setState({ who: nextWho });
  },

  render() {
    let message;

    if (this.state.who.trim() === '') {
      message = 'Hello?';
    }
    else {
      message = `Hello ${this.state.who}`;
    }

    return <div>
      <h1>{message}</h1>
      <input
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        type="text"
        value={this.state.who}
      />
    </div>;
  }
});

export default App;
```

Save the file and switch back to the browser. Play around with the user interface and, once everything is working, pat yourself on the back. You've just written your first React JSX user interface!

## What are the React Developer Tools?

The **React Developer Tools** are a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) and [Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/) that allow you to inspect and debug a React user interface from within the browser's developer tools panel. More specifically, the tools give you, the developer, access to the underlying React component hierarchy that's used to create and update the browser's DOM hierarchy.

The best way to understand what the React Developer Tools are capable of is to use them. So go ahead and install the tools for each browser using the links above. Once they're installed, refresh the **Hello world** user interface in Chrome. Then, open its developer tools panel and click on the React tab. You should see something like this.

### Exercise

Play around with the React Developer Tools and see what you can discover on your own. While you're playing, turn to a neighbor and, in your own words, explain what the React Developer Tools are. After about a minute, your instructor will cold call on the class and ask what was discussed.

## Why are the React Developer Tools important?

The React Developer Tools are important because they give you access to the underlying React component hierarchy that's used to create and update the browser's DOM hierarchy. For example, expanding and mousing over a component in the tree view on the left will highlight its corresponding DOM element in the browser window above.

Notice the colors of the collapsable triangles in the tree view. They provide extra information about their adjacent component.

| Triangle color | Component type  | Has state? |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Red            | Component class | Yes        |
| Black          | Component class | No         |
| Gray           | HTML tag        | N/A        |

### Exercise

In the main React Developer Tools window, click the `<h1>` component and use the breadcrumbs bar on the bottom of the panel to access it, its parent component, and its grandparent component. Then use the search bar to access the `<input />` component by its name.

Finally, turn to a neighbor and, in your own words, explain why the React Developer Tools are important. After about a minute, your instructor will cold call on the class and ask what was discussed.

## How do you use the React Developer Tools to inspect and debug a user interface?

By selecting a component in the tree view, you can inspect and debug its current props and state in the panel on the right. When a component's props or state value is changed, the component hierarchy is updated which, in this case, updates the DOM hierarchy.

**NOTE:** Not every change to a props or state value will result in an update to the DOM hierarchy. When it comes to component classes, it depends on the `ReactElement` object that's returned from its `render()` function.

With the React Developers Tools, you can finally see that a **component** is an instance of either a React component class or an HTML tag. And, a component hierarchy is made up of a root component with possible children, grandchildren, etc. You can confirm this by rendering a second component hierarchy for the **Hello world** user interface using the same root component class. Start by adding another user interface container to the `app/assets/index.html` file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Hello world</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/app.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <div id="anotherApp"></div>

    <script src="/vendor.js"></script>
    <script src="/app.js"></script>
    <script>require('index');</script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then, update the `app/index.jsx` file with another `ReactDOM.render()` function call to render another `<App />` component inside the new container.

```jsx
import App from './components/App';
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('anotherApp')
);
```

Switch back to the browser and voilà! Now, the user interface has two distinct and isolated component hierarchies.

In the React Developer Tools, both components are named `<App />` because their component class is stored in an indentifier named `App`. Remember, Babel automatically sets the value of the `displayName` property to the indentifier where the component class is stored. The React Developer Tools use this property when determining the name of a component.

## Summary

In this chapter, you were exposed to the fundamentals of React JSX, an HTML-like syntax for creating `ReactElement` objects. You practiced writing React JSX and transpiling it into JavaScript with a transpiler and a build tool. Additionally, you were exposed to the fundamentals of the React Developer Tools. You also practiced inspecting and debugging user interfaces written in React JSX. At this point, you're ready to write sophisticated React user interfaces.
